# Ogre

Ogre is a simple object graph manager, built with ReactJS in mind. You can create light-weight cursors that 'view' subtree paths of the main object graph. You can also listen for changes anywhere in the graph.

You can use it in node:

```bash
npm install --save ogre-js
```

Or the browser:

```bash
bower install --save ogre-js
```

# Todo

- Remove dependency on Underscore
